Nowadays, information technologies tend to distributed approaches making 
technologies based in centralized process, like identity management, having to 
adapt to new requirements.

Thus, a new approach, which is called decentralized identifiers (DIDs), appears
with the objective of identify, authenticate and authorize any entity, independent
of its trust source.

This project is focused in study of DIDs to develop a PoC a  distributed and
 universal identity management system.
